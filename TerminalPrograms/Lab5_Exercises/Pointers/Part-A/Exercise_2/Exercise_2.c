Since hexadecimal needs 16 digits (to represent digits 0-15), we use 0-9 and also a-f.
Note that a single hex character can express the same values that a 4-bit "nibble" can.
How many hex characters are needed to express a single byte? How many bytes are used
to store each address? Are your variables located in the first or the second half of the set
of all possible memory addresses?
